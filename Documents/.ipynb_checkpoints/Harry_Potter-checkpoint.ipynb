    "Professor Snape is frustrated because the punishment he had put upon Harry took half the time he expected. Now what we are doing here is elaborating what genius method he used to find all honest elves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "Harry made a list of the elves and paired them all with another elf, the one with their name next to them in the list. He then wondered how many cases of answer he might get asking each pair. Then he came up with the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>both call their pair honest</li>\n",
    "    <li>one liar and one honest</li>\n",
    "    <li>both call their pair liar</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the first case they either are both liar elves or both honest ones, in the second case they are either both liars or one is  an honest and the other is a liar one and the third case is the same as the second case. Harry intends to elimiante some elves on each step of the algorithm and his final goal is to be left alone with one elf which is certainly an honest elf.<br>\n",
    "Elimating the pairs that consist of one liar and one honest elf do not modify the assumption of the problem which is the number of honest elves is strictly more than the liars; also we can drop the pairs with two liars. Taking all that into account it is safe to say cases two and three do not belong to our newly modified list.<br>\n",
    "Now we still can remove some elves without contradicting the problem's initial assumption, if one of the elves in each pair of the first case is removed we are still left with a list of elves which has more honest elves than liar ones.<br>\n",
    "Since each elf's name has a different neighbor on the new list the steps above can be repeated until there is merely one elf left on a final list. This algorithm would work perfectly only if never on any recurssion the number of elves becomes an odd number ,however, apperantly we have been turning a blind eye to the fact that it is extremely farfetch for every list to consist of even number of elves. In that case two elves will be left on a final list which we will have to check what all the other elves think of those two elves and if more than half of the other elves think they are honest then we'll have to listen to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we had to give elves identities. So a class \"Elf\" is created which contains the name of the elf and the honesty status of the elf (For convenince elves are represented by their respective index in the initial list).\n"
